::Quick_OUT_LOOK::
The Dark_iCE DataBase  was and is built off YtDB  and our DB work  ... look it like there are two teams
working on one DB not only that but our DB also holds everything you need and more to run 
your DARK_iCE Server 

please if you notice anything, have something to commit, or any thing else 
please visit the site or open an issue

Here at Dark_iCE We stride to bring you a project that  will one day be as close to blizz as possible as well as having every
custom or neat thing you can think of one of the greatest things here is that anything custom or ect 
is purely option 

please be warned that players should only use the update packs and sql in the "for next update folder"  havent been perfected and when their ready they will 
be implented into a update pack down the line
still feel free to use them  but just be warned
